There is dump of DataBase and all needed files to use this app. 
You can see and edit some DataBase settings in file app/config/db_params.php.
I used PHP 7.4 and MySQL 8.0, but it also works with PHP 5.x and MySQL 5.7.
All this code I wrote by self except Paginator class. 
Use admin/admin as username/password to login as admin.
